\begin{example}
\textcolor{blue} {\emph{Refer to tutorial HW\_1\_MMATICA.nb, and Ch. 3, P. 134.}}
A two-dimensional rectangular plate length and width is ,  and on one boundary temperature , other three boundaries . The square is in steady state, what is the temperature at position , and  Sketch the temperature distribution.
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
To simplify the solution, use below transformation

According to heat diffusion equation, the two-dimensional, steady state with no internal heat generation equation is 

the transformed differential equation is then

Since the equation is second order in both x and y, two boundary conditions are needed for each of the coordinates, they are
